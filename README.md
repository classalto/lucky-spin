# Lucky Spin

###### created by: Victor Williams

##### Tooling

> This project is built using Javascript and the NodeJS runtime. I also use the prompt-sync module for user inputs.

##### How the web application works

> Choose some amount of available virtual bucks to bet on any possible combination of the rows of the slot machine. Then startup the lucky slot machine and nervously wait for the results! Behind the scenes the program will determine if you won and will perform the neccessary calculations to give your expected payout. Lastly, start a new spin if you still have virtual bucks.
